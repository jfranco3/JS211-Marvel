npm init
npm install dotenv --save
require('dotenv').config() at the top of your main.js
create a .gitignore file in the root folder
add .env to the .gitignore file
create a .env in the root folder and save your API key in it by...
adding something like SECRET_KEY=abcd1234 to the .env file
git add commit push...


Now clone it to your partner's machine
Repeat the .env file process so each of you have a copy of the API key
Work in separate branches (be careful of merge conflicts)
Focus on functionality first
Only style after you have all the functionality working
The projects can become a final project if you like. You can continue building them on your own or together. In class, however, we are just going to focus on accessing the API and doing a few simple things with the data we get back.



fetch a list of things
then put them on a pg somehow using variable
read documentation on how to get the info out
